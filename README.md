with other users. Each user will be able to draft players of their choice.
Depending on how the players on the team perform, the user may gain or lose points. 

This application allows users to:
- Draft players to their fantasy team
- Compete against other users
- Save their fantasy team to a file
- Load their fantasy team from a file
And more!
