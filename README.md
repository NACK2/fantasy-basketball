# My Personal Project: Fantasy Basketball

## Nicholas Kang

The project I am pursuing is **Fantasy Basketball**.

- **What will the application do?**

This desktop application will allow users to be in a fantasy basketball league 
with other users on the same computer. Each user will create a fantasy 
basketball team, and will have ability to draft players to their team.
Depending on how the players on a users team perform, the user may gain or
lose points. The person with the most points at the end of the season will
be the winner. 

- **Who will use it?**

Anyone interested in basketball and enjoy the idea of a hypothetical, 
fantasy basketball league can use this application.

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

This project interests me as I enjoy basketball. I have never had any 
experience  participating in fantasy basketball leagues myself, so this 
will be an opportunity for me to learn, research, and develop at the 
same time.
