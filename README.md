# My Personal Project: Fantasy Basketball 
### Nicholas Kang

The project I am pursuing is **Fantasy Basketball**.

- **What will the application do?**

This desktop application will allow users to be in a fantasy basketball league 
with other users on the same computer. Each user will be able to draft players
from the NBA of their choice, as long as they have not been taken by another user.
Depending on how the players on a users team perform, 
the user may gain or lose points. The user with the most points 
at the end of a season will be the winner. 

- **Who will use it?**

The people who can use this application are those who are interested in basketball and enjoy the idea of a hypothetical, 
fantasy basketball league between the game's greatest players.

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

The players drafted by the users will most likely not be teammates in reality,
therefore it interests me to experiment and create something that is impossible to confirm in real life.
I have never  participated in fantasy basketball leagues myself, so this 
will be an opportunity for me to learn, research, and develop at the 
same time.
