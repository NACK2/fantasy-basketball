# My Personal Project: The NBA's Top 75 Fantasy Basketball 
### Nicholas Kang

The project I am pursuing is **The NBA's Top 75 Fantasy Basketball**.

- **What will the application do?**

This desktop application will allow users to be in a fantasy basketball league 
with other users on the same computer. The catch is, the 
league will only consist of the NBA's top 75 players in the history of its game,
which was released as an official list by the NBA itself. 
Each user will create a fantasy basketball team, and will have ability to 
draft players to their team. Depending on how the players on a users team perform, 
the user may gain or lose points. The person with the most points 
at the end of a season will be the winner. 

- **Who will use it?**

The people who can use this application are those who are interested in basketball and enjoy the idea of a hypothetical, 
fantasy basketball league between the game's greatest players.

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

This project interests me as I can experiment with something that is
impossible to confirm in real life. Since the top 75 list of NBA players 
consists of many retired players, it is impossible to know what the outcome of
this sort of match would be in reality. I have never had any 
experience  participating in fantasy basketball leagues myself, so this 
will be an opportunity for me to learn, research, and develop at the 
same time.
